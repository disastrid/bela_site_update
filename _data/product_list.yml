  - title: Bela
    desc: The original Bela board has everything you need to start creating beautifully interactive applications. With 8 16-bit analog I/O and 16 digital I/O you can hook up all your favourite sensors and devices, and get programming with our browser-based IDE. Bela is compatible with our multiplexer and audio expander capelets, and has on-board stereo amps, making this our most fully-featured system. Bela is available as a starter kit (full system including Bela cape + BeagleBone Black, USB cable, Bela cape and two audio adapter cables), or as a stand-alone cape.

  - title: Bela Mini
    desc: 'In 2018 we condensed all the most popular features of Bela into one tiny system that fits in more places than ever before. The Bela Mini is 1/3 the size of the Original Bela, but still powerful - it has 8 16-bit analog inputs, 16 digital I/O and stereo audio I/O. Bela Mini uses the same Bela software as the original, so you still get access to our browser-based IDE in a much smaller form factor. Bela Mini is available as a starter kit (fully assembled system including soldered Bela Mini cape + PocketBeagle, USB cable, SD card and 2 audio adapter cables), or as a stand-alone cape.'
